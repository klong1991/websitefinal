                interview with
                <strong>Pro Beez</strong>
                for <strong>Pep Talk UK</strong> his trainer Mark Tibbs wasn't allowing himself to say to
                much and kept
                swerving any questions about Billy Joe saying that he had only been in contact via text
                messages since the
                fight and that he couldn't possibly speak for Billy at this time. Leaving fans wondering if
                Billy will ever
                return to the ring again.
